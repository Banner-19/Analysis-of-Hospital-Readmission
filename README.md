# Analysis-of-Hospital-Readmission
Measures to predict 30-day readmission are considered an important quality factor for hospitals as they can reduce the overall cost of care through identification of high risk patients and allow allocation of resources accordingly.Hospital readmission refers to a patient being admitted again to the hospital for the same or related care within a specific period after discharge. This issue is significant in the healthcare sector because it leads to higher hospitalization costs, decreased patient satisfaction, and an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as infections, medication errors, and even death. The problem is particularly pronounced in intensive care units (ICUs) due to the severity of patients' conditions and the high risk of complications.

## Overview
### Complexity of Predicting Unplanned Readmissions in ICUs
- **Data Modalities**: Predicting readmissions involves analyzing various data types, including static data, unstructured free text, sequences of diagnoses and procedures, and multivariate time-series data.
- **Machine Learning Approaches**: The use of advanced machine learning techniques, including time-series analysis and natural language processing (NLP), to evaluate the effectiveness of each data modality individually and in combination.

### Evaluation Process and Findings
- **Contribution of Data Modalities**: Through rigorous evaluation, the study determines the predictive value of each data modality and establishes a hierarchy of their effectiveness in predicting readmissions.
- **Temporal Abstractions**: The study highlights the role of temporal abstractions in enhancing the performance of time-series models for readmission prediction.

### Definitions and Consistency
- **Unplanned Readmission**: To improve reproducibility and prevent misunderstandings due to varying definitions in the literature, the study provides a clear and consistent definition of "Unplanned Readmission."

### Experimental Results
- **Benchmark Data Set**: Utilizing a large clinical data set, the study demonstrates that discharge notes written by physicians have a higher predictive value for readmissions compared to other data modalities.

## Objective
The objectives of this analysis are:
1. **Improving Predictive Accuracy**: Enhance the accuracy of unplanned readmission predictions by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and evaluating different data modalities.
2. **Enhancing Interpretability**: Develop methods to make high-dimensional medical data more understandable, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions.
3. **Standardizing Definitions**: Provide a clear definition of unplanned readmission to ensure consistency and reproducibility in future research.
4. **Optimizing Patient Outcomes**: Ultimately, reduce hospital readmission rates by accurately predicting at-risk patients and implementing timely interventions, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
